# Experimental Features

This section covers features in `grove-context` that are either under active development, have specialized use cases, or are not recommended for general production use. Proceed with caution and be aware that these features may change or be removed in future versions.

## Hot & Cold Context Separation (⚠️ WARNING: EXPERIMENTAL)

**CRITICAL WARNING:** This feature is highly experimental and can lead to substantial and unexpected charges when used with caching-enabled LLM providers like Google's Gemini API. It is **not recommended for general use**. Misconfiguration, such as an improperly set TTL or frequent changes to the cold context, can result in the consumption of a very large number of cached tokens.

The hot and cold context feature separates the context into two distinct parts:
*   **Hot Context**: Intended for files that are actively changing or are directly relevant to the immediate task. This is the standard context generated by default.
*   **Cold Context**: Intended for stable, foundational files like libraries, frameworks, or dependencies that provide background information but change infrequently. The goal is to send this context once and have it cached by the LLM provider.

While the separation logic is implemented, the caching behavior and cost implications are still under evaluation, making this feature unsafe for production workflows.

## MCP Integration for Automatic Context Management

`grove-context` is designed to be integrated with `grove-mcp` (Model Context Protocol server), which enables LLM-based agents to interact with local development tools. Through the MCP protocol, an agent can be granted permissions to execute `cx` commands.

This allows for automated workflows where an agent can:
*   Analyze the current context with `cx stats`.
*   Modify the context rules with `cx edit` or `cx set-rules`.
*   Generate context from recent Git changes using `cx from-git`.

This integration facilitates more autonomous agent behavior by giving them the ability to manage their own understanding of a codebase.
