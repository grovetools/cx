# Documentation Task: Getting Started Tutorial

Write a quick-start tutorial for a new user of `grove-context` (`cx`). The goal is to guide them through the most common workflow.

## Task
Create a step-by-step guide that covers the following sequence:
1.  **Initialize Rules:** Show how to use `cx edit` to create the initial `.grove/rules` file.
2.  **Define Rules:** Provide a simple but practical example rules file (e.g., include all `.go` files, exclude `_test.go` files).
3.  **Visualize and Refine:** Explain how to use `cx view` to interactively see which files are included and verify the rules are working as expected.
4.  **Generate Context:** Show the `cx generate` command to create the `.grove/context` file.
5.  **Use the Context:** Demonstrate how to use `cx show` and pipe the output to the clipboard (e.g., `cx show | pbcopy` on macOS).
